# What is Html2OpenXml?

Html2OpenXml is a small .Net library that convert simple or advanced HTML to plain OpenXml components. This program has started in 2009, initially to convert user's comments into Word.

This library supports both **.Net Framework 4.6.2**, **.NET Standard 2.0** and **.NET 8** which are all LTS.

Depends on [DocumentFormat.OpenXml](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DocumentFormat.OpenXml/) and [AngleSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AngleSharp).

## Supported Html tags

Refer to [w3schoolsâ€™ tag](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) list to see their meaning

* `a`
* `h1-h6`
* `abbr` and `acronym`
* `b`, `i`, `u`, `s`, `del`, `ins`, `em`, `strike`, `strong`
* `br` and `hr`
* `img`, `figcaption`
* `table`, `td`, `tr`, `th`, `tbody`, `thead`, `tfoot`, `caption` and `col`
* `cite`
* `div`, `span`, `time`, `font` and `p`
* `pre`
* `sub` and `sup`
* `ul`, `ol` and `li`
* `dd` and `dt`
* `q`, `blockquote`, `dfn`
* `article`, `aside`, `section` are considered like `div`

Javascript (`script`), CSS `style`, `meta`, comments, buttons and input controls are ignored.
Other tags are treated like `div`.

In v1 and v2, Javascript (`script`), CSS `style`, `meta`, comments and other not supported tags does not generate an error but are **ignored**.

## Html Parser

In v3, the parsing of the Html relies on AngleSharp package, which follows the W3C specifications and actively supports Html5.

In v1 and v2, the parsing of the Html was done using a custom Regex-based enumerator and was more flexible, but leaving a complex code, hard to maintain.

## How to implement or debug features

My reference bibles cover both OpenXml and HTML:

* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
* [OpenXml MSDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/documentformat.openxml.wordprocessing?view=openxml-3.0.1)

Open MS Word or Apple Pages and design your expected output. Save as a DOCX file, then rename as a ZIP. Extract the content and inspect those files:
`document.xml`, `numbering.xml` (for list) and `styles.xml`.
